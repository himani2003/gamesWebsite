# GAMING WEBSITE USING PYTHON
In the Python ecosystem, we can find a rich set of tools, libraries, and frameworks that will help to create games quickly. We chose Python for this project because it’s a simple language to start out with, and is fun and easy to learn.

### Home Page


The home page contains a SIGN-IN icon. It’s a page created using HTML and CSS. We created a hover effect on the SIGN-IN icon. This page tells a little about the website and features it contains.

### Sign-Up page


The sign-up page contains username, email id and password. Text cursor is used to fill in the details. For sign-in all the fields are mandatory to fill if we leave any of the fields blank an alert pops up to fill it. Visitors first choose the username, then email id and password. Then they click on the sign-up icon. Visitors get registered on the website and their data gets stored in local storage. We can also clear the credentials from local storage when it gets full.


### Sign-In Page

To sign-in we have to fill the email id and password correctly then click on the sign-in icon and the content page opens.

### Egg Catcher game Page


This page contains an egg catcher game which is made in python using Tkinter, itertools and random. We have to collect eggs in the basket which keep falling from random positions to increase your score. We can move this basket using arrow keys.  When an egg is missed, a life is lost. So after 3 chances are up, Game is over. Click on the button to play a game, this button is made with HTML and CSS which changes color when we hover the cursor above it. 

### Dots and Boxes


This page contains dots and boxes game made with Python using tkinter and numpy modules.. Starting with an empty grid of dots, players take turns, adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1 × 1 box earns one point and takes another turn. The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner of the game is the player with the most points.

However, it will crush the moment the rocks fall upon it. You need to collect as many snowballs falling from the sky to keep yours alive the longest.

### Pacman Game


This game is made using numpy, pygame, and game modules. In this game , the player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding red colored ghosts . If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he will lose his life. Here the eating dots is the Scoring factor. The game shows the total score of the player in the corner.

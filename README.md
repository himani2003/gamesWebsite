The sign-up page contains username, email id and password. Text cursor is used to fill in the details. For sign-in all the fields are mandatory to fill if we leave any of the fields blank an alert pops up to fill it. Visitors first choose the username, then email id and password. Then they click on the sign-up icon. Visitors get registered on the website and their data gets stored in local storage. We can also clear the credentials from local storage when it gets full.
